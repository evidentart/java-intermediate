# Grab N' Go Snacks and Such

The "Grab N' Go Snacks and Such" project is a Java application that simulates a snack vending machine. Users can choose a row to view available snacks and select an item to enjoy. The application utilizes Java's input handling and switch-case statements to provide a simple and interactive snack selection experience.

## Code Structure
The project consists of the following main components:
- `App`: Class representing the snack vending machine application.
- `displayItems`: Method to display the available snacks in a chosen row.
- `selectItem`: Method to select and display the chosen snack from the row.

## Key Java Practices
- Input handling using the Scanner class
- Implementation of conditional logic with switch-case statements
- Method creation and utilization for displaying and selecting items
- Proper naming conventions and code organization

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
