# Java Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Java projects, each designed to demonstrate key Java practices and concepts. These projects showcase the four pillars of Java practices - object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation - as well as other important concepts in Java programming.

## Projects Overview

The projects in this repository are focused on demonstrating fundamental Java practices and concepts, including:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Inheritance and its application in building class hierarchies
- Polymorphism and its use in implementing dynamic behavior
- Encapsulation and its role in data protection and abstraction
- Input handling and exception handling
- Code organization and naming conventions

## Getting Started

Each project is contained in its own directory and can be run independently. Simply navigate to the project directory and follow the instructions in the project's README file to get started.
