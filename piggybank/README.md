# PiggyBank App

This is a simple PiggyBank application that allows you to deposit money into the piggybank and break it to get your money back.

## Key Java Practices

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation
- Constructor Overloading
- Access Modifiers
- Use of Scanner class
- Proper Naming Conventions

## Code Structure

The code consists of the following main components:
- `PiggyBank`: Model class to represent the piggybank.
- `PiggyBankService`: Service class to handle operations on the piggybank.
- `App`: Main class to run the piggybank application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the piggybank application, simply clone the repository and run the `App` class.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
