# Super Hero App

Simple super hero program to demostrate the core concept of Java.

## Key Java Practices

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with the use of classes and objects
- Use of constructors for class initialization
- Exception handling with try-catch blocks
- Input handling using the Scanner class
- Implementation of conditional logic with switch-case statements
- Method overriding for custom behavior
- Proper naming conventions and code organization

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
