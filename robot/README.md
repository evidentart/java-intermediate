# Robots R Us

This is a simple application that allows you to choose and activate different types of robots.

## Key Java Practices

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with the use of classes and objects
- Use of constructors for the Robot class
- Proper Naming Conventions
- Use of the Scanner class for user input handling
- Implementation of conditional logic for robot activation based on user input

## Code Structure

The code consists of the following main components:
- `App`: Main class to run the robot selection application.
- `models`: Folder containing model classes for different types of robots.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
